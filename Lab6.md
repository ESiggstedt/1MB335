# Session 6 - project
For the following labs you will work on a evolutionary biology project were you will try to answer one of the questions below using phylogenetic methods. You will be randomly assigned one of the questions. You will need to gather your own dataset for the analysis. We (the lab assistans) will help and guide you so that you end up with a suitable dataset, but ultimately the choise of samples is yours. 

## Questions:
1. Are bats more closely related to horses than to cows?
  
2. Do marsupials form a monophyletic group (i.e. clade)?

3. Both whales and dugongs originate from landliving animals. Did this land-to-water transition occur twice independently?

4. Are salamanders more closely related to frogs than to lizards?

5. What are the closest relatives of octopuses and squids?

6. Is the guinea pig more closely related to rats than to pigs?

7. What feline (cat-like animals) is most closely related to the cheetah?

8. Are egg-laying mammals (platypus and echidna) more closely related to marsupials than to placental mammals?


### Pointers

When chosing your species you need to think about what species you want to test/compare i.e. your ingroup as well as your outgroup:

The test in the above figure would have been to see if `C` is more related to `B` or to `D`, and the answer would then be that `C` is closer to`D`. 

* 3 You will of course have to have some whales and dugongs but also several different clades of landliving mamals to determine the potential closest relatives.

* 5  In order to be able to answer this question you will need to have species from _several_ different distinct lineages as well as a few squids/octopuses. 



You will start with compiling your datasets in this lab. The following labs, 7 till 8, will introduce different phylogenetic methods, programs and tools that you will apply to the dataset you compiled. You will have to submit a few items along the way.


**N.B.** Since you are going to produce quite a lot of files, try to use self-explanatory files names and a good structure of folders. It will make your work easier. It might be a good idea to write a short description about how the archive is organized and where the files are (trees, scripts, alignments and so forth)
