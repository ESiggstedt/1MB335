# Session 6 Project

For the rest of this lab course you will work on a project were you will answer an evolutionary questions using phyologenetic methods. In order to accomplish this you will have to find the data to use on your own. We (the lab assistants) will of course be there help you and guide you, but we wil not _give_ you the data you need. You will be assigned one of the questions below:

## The questions:

* 1) Are bats more closely related to horses than to cows?

*  2) Do marsupials form a monophyletic group (i.e. clade)?
* 3) Both whales and dugongs originate from landliving animals. Did this land-to-water transition occur twice independently?

* 4) Are salamanders more closely related to frogs than to lizards?

* 5) What are the closest relatives of octopuses and squids?

* 6) Is the guinea pig more closely related to rats than to pigs?

* 7) What feline (cat-like animals) is most closely related to the cheetah?

* 8) Are egg-laying mammals (platypus and echidna) more closely related to marsupials than to placental mammals?


### Pointers 

In general, think hard about **ingroup** and **outgroups**. That is, which animals or groups of animals do i need as the query (ingroup) and who am I comparing it to?  And what animals fall without the question (Outgroup).

Some clarification for the questions that are a bit less straight forward


2) A suggestion would be to gather several different marsupials with varying degrees of realtedness. Your outgroup should then not be a marsupial.

5) To answer this question you will need to gather some, squids and octopuses (octopi) _and_ some related candidates, as well as an outgroup to all the other species.
